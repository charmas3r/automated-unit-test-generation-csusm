A3Test paper - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10352.pdf
Replicate A3Test - https://github.com/awsm-research/a3test
Asif will provide access to the cluster (for model training and potentially cirumventing KotlinDL Arm64 issues)

Proposed new thesis:
Create a new repository for training a model on Kotlin code, similar to Methods2Test
Training with the latest and greatest ML models (AthenaTest, GPT, A3Test, EvoSuite, RandLoop, etc)
